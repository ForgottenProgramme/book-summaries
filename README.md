# Book Summaries
Writing down what one learnt is a great way to revise and cement one's learnings in one's mind.<br> 
This is a place where I write short summaries of the books I read, in the form of blogs. You can read these blogs on my [website](https://forgottenprogramme.github.io/book-summaries/).
